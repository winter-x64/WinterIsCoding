# WinterIsCoding

A cool and cozy theme for VS Code, Made by winter_x64.

Hey Everyone, I just wanted to thank everyone who installed my theme on vscode. WinterlsCoding is my first ever product that I released a few months ago to the public I never thought that I would get 100 installs, I know it's not a huge number, but for me it's a really really big number. So once again, I want to thank everyone for using my theme and thanks for the support *
